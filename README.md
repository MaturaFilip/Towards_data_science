# Towards data science challenge

Complete data science self-paced curriculum from multiple resources (books, courses, guided projects, own projects)

The goal is to better understand data wrangling, data modeling and how overall understand how can data be used to solve real world problems.

## Rules:
- 15h/week study at minimum.
- Finish every assignment in course, book etc.
- Share assignments in github repo.
- After every course, book etc, small project should be done (except for math classes)

Note: Courses, books can be added, removed during the challenge (course could be bad etc.), 15h/week should be in average over year - sometimes there is no time in week because of work.

In 2026 we have 53 weeeks, that means I should study in total 795 hours at minimum.
